# Triplet Loss SBIR
This repo contains code for the CVIU 2016 paper "[Compact Descriptors for Sketch-based Image Retrieval using a Triplet loss Convolutional Neural Network](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cviu.2017.06.007)" 

To download the pretrained model and datasets, please go to our [project page](www.cvssp.org/data/Flicrk25K).

To extract cnn features, please run the script get_cnn_feat.py. It accepts sketch or photo edgemaps in lmdb format. For convenience you can download the pre-packed test lmdbs (Flickr15K) on our project page.
